Name of Project: Furever

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- frontend ui preferably smooth that is presentable and querys a TBD API.
-Integration with reliable API that has updated animal adoption listings. Petfinder for devs is best canidate atm but considering others if not multiple at once. Has good documention!

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

 -React, Javascript, HTML, for UI. Not sure how state will be managed quite yet if at all (considering javascript route). I need to progress further on react tract to decide for sure.
 -Postman

- -Possible C# /.NET framework for API -Considering making a C# API for the backend just as a proof of concept
- Display for mobile app and presentation
- Other features such as filter tabs, search page, additonal resources page, popups, state tests.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- query petfinder api-check
- hierarchy of needs?
- add component tree?
1/30/24
- sr developer friend recommended Capacitorjs as native runtime environment - mobile friendly: possible mobile overlay for presentation or native app.
 1/31/24
 - starting in react w/hooks and adding branches for CapacitorJs, react native?
 -researched and read about mobile technologies for integrating app.  Capacitor seems to allow to keep everything unchanged after adding wiht light mods. React Native requires us to create all UI components from scratch, but we can keep redux/logic. 
 -ai chatbot implimentation branch further down road? 
 2/03/24 -2/04/24
 -practice with react components + first component tree + md
